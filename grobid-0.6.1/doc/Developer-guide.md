### Unit tests of Grobid Parsers

Sometimes you want to test methods of a grobid parser, without having to instantiate and load the wapiti model.
We recommend separating tests that require wapiti models and call them with a name ending with `IntegrationTest.java` with proper unit tests (using names ending with `Test.java`). 
If you set up a Continuous Integration system, is probably better to exclude integration tests, while they might not work if the grobid-home is properly set up. 

You can exclude Integration tests by default in your gradle.build, by adding: 

```groovy
test {
    exclude '**/**IntegrationTest**'
}
```
   
The DUMMY model (``GrobidModels.DUMMY``) is an artifact to instantiate a GrobidParser wihtout having the model under the grobid-home. 

This is useful for unit test of different part of the parser, for example if you have a method that read the sequence labelling results and assemble into a set of objects. 

**NOTE**: this method unfortunately cannot avoid problems when the Lexicons are used in the parser. A solution for that is that you mock the Lexicon and pass it as method to the parser. Some additional information can be found [here](https://github.com/kermitt2/grobid/issues/410#issuecomment-478888438). 

```java
    public class SuperconductorsParserTest {
    private SuperconductorsParser target;
    private ChemDataExtractorClient mockChemspotClient;

    @Before
    public void setUp() throws Exception {
        //Example of a mocked version of an additional service that is passed to the parser
        mockChemspotClient = EasyMock.createMock(ChemDataExtractorClient.class);
    
        // Passing GrobidModels.DUMMY 
        target = new SuperconductorsParser(GrobidModels.DUMMY, mockChemspotClient);
    }
    
    @Test
    public void test1() throws Exception {
        target.myMethod();
    }
}
```
